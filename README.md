The Prediction of Big Mart Sales 
# Project Outline

### 1. Problem Definition
I aimed to define the specific objectives of my sales forecasting project. The goals included:
- Predicting sales for each product and store for the next year, given that only one year of data was available.
- Identifying factors affecting sales.

### 2. Dataset
I gathered relevant data for analysis, which included:
- Historical sales data (daily, weekly, or monthly).
- Product details (type, brand, etc.).
- Store details (location, size, years of operation, etc.).
- External factors (holidays, promotions, etc.).

### 3. Data Cleaning and Exploration
I cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I explored the data to understand its structure and relationships using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

### 4. Model Selection
I chose appropriate forecasting models, focusing on common models for time series forecasting such as:
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

### 5. Model Training
I split the data into training and validation sets, trained the selected models on the training set, and validated their performance on the validation set.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
I fine-tuned model parameters for better performance, recognizing this step as crucial for machine learning models.

### 7. Model Evaluation
I evaluated the models using appropriate metrics, including:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.

### 8. Forecasting
I used the trained model to forecast future sales and planned to update the model periodically with new data.

## Future Work

### 9. Time Series Analysis
Recognizing that sales data is likely time-dependent, I performed time series analysis to:
- Explore trends, seasonality, and cycles in the data.
- Decompose time series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.

### 10. Deployment
I plan to deploy the forecasting model in a real-world setting, which may involve integrating the model into existing systems or creating a dashboard for end-users.

### 11. Monitoring and Maintenance
I will regularly monitor model performance and update the model as needed, ensuring it adapts to changing sales patterns over time.
